## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a healthcare solution that helps users check for potential heart disease. By analyzing medical inputs like Age, Cholesterol, and Blood Pressure, the Machine Learning model provides an instant prediction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 🐍
* **Framework:** Streamlit (For the Web Interface)
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
* **Deployment:** Render.com

## 🚀 Key Features
- **OOPs Implementation:** The entire logic is built using Python Classes and Objects for better code structure.
- **ML Pipeline:** Includes automated data scaling and model training.
- **User-Friendly UI:** Simple form-based interface for easy data entry.
- **Instant Results:** Fast and accurate predictions based on a trained Random Forest model.

## 📊 Dataset Information
The model is trained on 13 medical attributes:
1. Age 2. Sex 3. Chest Pain Type 4. Resting BP 5. Cholesterol 6. Fasting Blood Sugar 7. Resting ECG 8. Max Heart Rate 9. Exercise Angina 10. ST Depression 11. Slope 12. Number of Major Vessels 13. Thal

## 📈 Model Performance
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Preprocessing:** Standard Scaling (to normalize medical data)
- **Interface:** Interactive Streamlit Dashboard
- **Result:** Provides instant 'Healthy' or 'Risk' status based on input parameters.

## 🛠️ Project Methodology (OOPs)
Following professional coding standards, the project is built using:
- **Modular Classes:** Separate logic for model training and prediction.
- **Data Pipeline:** Seamless flow from raw CSV data to scaled feature arrays.
- **Exception Handling:** Basic logging and error management to ensure smooth user experience.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- [ ] Integration of real-time patient monitoring data.
- [ ] Adding more Classification algorithms (like XGBoost or SVM) for comparison.
- [ ] Implementing a Cloud Database to store history.
